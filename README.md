# Subnet Calculator

Hey there! The Subnet Calculator is a cool Python-based command-line tool that helps you work with network subnets. It's super handy for all your subnet planning and management needs.

## Features

- Calculate subnets easily using an IPv4 address and subnet mask (in CIDR notation).
- You can even specify how many subnets you want to calculate (optional).
- It gives you all the important details for each subnet, like network addresses, first and last hosts, broadcast addresses, and the next subnet.
- There are error messages with clear explanations, just in case something goes wrong.
- It has a user-friendly command-line interface that's easy to use.

## Getting Started

Here's how you can get started with the Subnet Calculator:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your own computer. Use the following command (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yasuke2000/subnet-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Go into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd subnet-calculator
   ```

3. **Run the Calculator**: Start the subnet calculator script with Python:

   ```bash
   python subnet_calculator.py
   ```

4. **Follow the Prompts**: Just follow the on-screen prompts. It's as easy as 1-2-3:

   - Choose an option:
     - `1` to calculate subnets.
     - `2` to exit the program.

   - Enter the IP address you want to work with (e.g., `192.168.1.0`).

   - Type in the subnet mask using CIDR notation (e.g., `/24`).

   - If you want to calculate a specific number of subnets, enter that number. Otherwise, just press Enter to calculate all possible subnets.

5. **View the Subnet Configurations**: The calculator will display the subnet configurations right on your screen. That's it!

## Example

For example, let's say you want to calculate 3 subnets for the IP address `192.168.1.0` with a subnet mask of `/24`:

```bash
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the IP address: 192.168.1.0
Enter the subnet mask (in CIDR notation, e.g., /18): /24
Enter the number of subnets (press Enter to calculate all): 3
```

The calculator will show you the configurations for those 3 subnets.
